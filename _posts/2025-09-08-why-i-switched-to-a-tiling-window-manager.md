title: Why I switched to a tiling window manager

After years of using traditional desktop environments with floating windows, I made the switch to a tiling window manager. It's been one of the best productivity improvements I've made.

## The Problem with Floating Windows

Floating windows are flexible but require constant manual arrangement. You spend mental energy deciding where each window goes, resizing them, and managing overlap. For developers who spend hours in their editor and terminal, this overhead adds up.

## The Tiling Solution

A tiling window manager automatically arranges windows in non-overlapping tiles. Every pixel is used efficiently, and window focus follows logical keyboard commands rather than mouse clicks.

## Benefits

- **Speed**: No mouse needed for window management
- **Focus**: Fewer decisions about layout means more focus on code
- **Keyboard-first**: Everything is accessible via keybindings
- **Consistency**: Layouts are predictable and reproducible

The learning curve is real, but the payoff in terms of workflow efficiency is significant. If you spend significant time at the terminal, it's worth exploring.
