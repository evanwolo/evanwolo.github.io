title: Reflecting on minimalist software design

In a world of feature bloat and complexity, minimalist design stands out. The principle of doing one thing well applies to software as much as it does to physical products.

When you strip away the unnecessary, you're left with something that's easier to understand, maintain, and use. This doesn't mean your software lacks power—it means every feature earns its place.

Some principles I've found valuable:
- **Start simple**: Begin with the core problem, not edge cases
- **Resist feature creep**: Each addition should solve a real problem
- **Document ruthlessly**: If it's not obvious, explain it
- **Test the essentials**: Focus on what matters most to users

Clean, minimal code often outperforms overcomplicated solutions in every dimension: speed, maintainability, and user satisfaction.
